Summary:
This report demonstrates the SPI Interface for a SRAM. The SPI Interface is implemented for a slave, which reads data from the SDI port at the positive edge of the clock and sends the data out from the SDO port at the negative edge of the clock. Data-path and controller design is implemented using Hardware Description language - Verilog. We used ModelSim and Icarus tools to simulate and check the results.

Programming Language:
Verilog
